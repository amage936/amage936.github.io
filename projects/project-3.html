    <meta name="description" content="Located in Chicago, NEXT is a corporate office designed to redefine the modern workplace through the balance of these three pillars:  wellbeing, creativity, and collaboration.

NEXT will prioritizes functionality and safety through ADA certifications and ensuring accessibility for all. Thoughtfully designed seating and multiple pathways will be provided to allow comfort for all . The office layout promotes efficiency, with closely related departments strategically positioned to enhance teamwork and communication.

To support wellbeing, NEXT includes a dedicated wellbeing area, private phone booths, and quiet zones for moments of
 focus or relaxation. These spaces are designed to empower employees as they 
take  care of their physical and mental
 health. 

The creativity pillar is reinforced by flexible workspaces, allowing employees to adapt their environment to their needs. Whether seeking privacy or a change of perspective, staff can seamlessly move to different areas with their laptops, invigorating their
 creativity and productivity.

At NEXT, collaboration is at the heart of the design. Inviting collaborative zones  and comfortable workspaces encourages spontaneous brainstorming, teamwork, and the free exchange of ideas. By blending thoughtful design, functionality, and adaptability, NEXT provides a dynamic workplace that evolves with its people—creating a space where they can connect, innovate, and thrive.
